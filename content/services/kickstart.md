Starting in the cloud is easy: create an account, fill in your credit card details and start clicking around to deploy cloud services. But doing it properly is more difficult. You will quickly run into the following challenges:

- How to setup a safe and scalable account structure?
- How to keep track of who deploys what?
- How to make optimal use of the cloud, but avoid a complete lock-in?
- How to keep your cost under control?

We help you to answer these questions. With our Cloud Kickstart, we get you up and running in weeks, while making sure your cloud environment is secure, scalable and compliant.
