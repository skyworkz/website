I've spent the better part of the past decade designing, building, and running platforms. Those platforms have differed in many ways, but what all of them had in common was that they were built so that software could be deployed and run. In recent years, more and more companies have begun to realize they need to 'be good at shipping software' and have subsequently increased their efforts in that area, often resulting in the creation of bespoke platforms.

In this series of blog posts I will go over various aspects of designing platforms. Things to consider, approaches that work (or don't), and general guidelines for designing platforms that are usable, maintainable, secure, and allow for future development.
