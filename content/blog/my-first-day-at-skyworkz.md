Starting a new job is always exciting; new people, a new environment, a new assignment... you name it. After having worked with the same company (Piggy Loyalty) for 7.5 years, it felt like an extra big step, leaving behind amazing people and also that feeling of comfort.

## What to do on a first day?
### Expectations

What do you expect from a first day at a new job? I've asked ChatGPT and it came back with this list:

* Onboarding and Orientation: Employees generally expect to receive a thorough onboarding process, including an orientation session that familiarizes them with the company culture, policies, procedures, and their specific job responsibilities. This may involve meeting with HR representatives, signing necessary paperwork, and receiving an introduction to their team or colleagues.

* Training and Support: New employees often anticipate receiving the necessary training and support to perform their job effectively. They expect to receive guidance and resources that will help them understand their role, learn new skills, and become acquainted with the tools, systems, and processes required for their work.

* Clear Expectations: People expect to receive clear and specific expectations from their supervisor or manager regarding their job performance. This includes understanding their goals, objectives, and key performance indicators, as well as any specific deadlines or targets they need to meet.

For me this list feels and sounds pretty clinical. My worst experience ever at a new job, was when I came into the office and there was nobody there and nothing was setup or arranged. So to me, the above list can be summarized into: Make somebody feel welcome and have any things they might require or need ready. This can be simple things like a desk, their e-mail address set up, etc.

### And what did I do?

For most of us, your first day is probably (and hopefully?!) a mix of the above list. Getting to know a lot of new people and having to remember their names. Luckily I already know a few people at Skyworkz, since we've worked with them in the past! So what to do then when your expectations have already been met before you even have your first day? Well... visit a conference offcourse! Bas mentioned he was going to visit the AWS Summit in Amsterdam and encouraged me to also sign-up and join with some other colleagues.

## AWS Summit
For me it was the first time visiting a conference organized by one of the big cloud providers. My experience in the cloud has mostly been with GCP, so I was curious to see and learn more about AWS. What are they working on, their ideas, plans, etc.

The keynote talk was quite interesting and perhaps not surprisingly the big hype word was "Generative AI". AWS is working on a lot of services and new ideas. Most of these sadly aren't available to the general public yet, but for all you AWS users out there, definitely keep an eye on these developments.

### CodeWhisperer
[Amazon CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/) is a service I wanted to highlight, since this can already be used and fits in line with ChatGPT, Github Co-pilot, etc. If you're looking into code generation and working with AWS, CodeWhisperer is maybe something you should try out. According to their website: "In addition to general purpose code suggestions, CodeWhisperer has additional training to provide code suggestions for using AWS APIs." So it should arguebly be able to generate better working code for any AWS services/API's you use.

While I understand that this summit is (mostly) used as a marketing tool, I would have liked to have seen more in-depth talks or workshops. Some of my new colleagues felt the same way. But all in all it was a nice day and well organized for sure!


## Blipz

Speaking of well organised events and new technologies, last year I was invited to [Blipz](https://www.blipz.io/), "The Tech conference with a twist
in cooperation with Dataworkz, Skyworkz, Groundworkz, Lemonshark, Cyberseals and Codebeez"! It was a great success, with many interesting topics. And you guessed it, this year we're organizing another one! The call to papers has been closed, we've had a whopping 64 submissions this year! All this talk about Generative AI and it's extreme growth the last year also leads to a lot of discussion about how this will impact us. Here is a teaser for one of the keynotes:


*In a world captivated by artificial intelligence (AI), where ChatGPT, deep learning, and Large Language Models dominate the headlines, a remarkable transformation is underway. While the debate rages on about job displacement versus job creation, the true impact of AI might lie elsewhere.*

*It's time to look beyond the surface. The essence of a complex system lies not in its components but in the dynamic relationships between them. How will AI reshape our collaboration? Traditionally, humans instructed computers, but now we witness machines setting objectives for people. Prepare yourselves for a future revolution in our work methods.*

*What might change in how people work together? Join us as we delve into the fascinating realm of AI's (possible) future influence on our Ways of Working.*
