      #### About us

      Skyworkz is a boutique consultancy with a focus on cloud based in Utrecht.
      We are a diverse group of cloud consultants, who like to **share knowledge** and
      work on interesting projects. Technology is not only our work but also our
      passion. But a **healthy work/life balance** is important as well.

      #### About the role

      We are looking for cloud consultants who want to make a difference. Instead
      of just staffing projects, we closely look to your skills, experience and
      ambition, and try to match that with a **challenging assignment**. The projects
      vary in length between 3 to 18 months. We always help customers with the end in
      mind: after the project, the client needs to be able to stand on his own feet.

      #### About you

      You are **passionate** about building scalable and reliable cloud platforms for
      developers. In your work, you constantly **balance pragmatism and quality**. You're
      not a ticket ticker but a builder and a teamplayer. You are able to translate
      business requirements into practical architecture. You are able to communicate the
      advantages of the cloud to both business and techies.


      Next to that, you're a polyglot **developer/scripter** and would almost call yourself
      a programmer. But writing business code is less interesting to you, you like to bridge
      the gap between code and infrastructure. You are a problem solver. There is no type of
      infrastructure that you haven't **automated**, no application that you haven't
      **containerized**. You are allergic to the word **DevOps**: another inflated buzzword.
      It's all about **collaboration, communication and automation**. No need for buzzwords.

      #### Good to know

      We expect you to be a consultant: you shape your own assignment, you are entrepreneurial
      and you're **not afraid** of new environments. You have been in the Netherlands for more than
      a year already, so you are familiar with the Dutch culture and way of working.

      #### Benefits

      We offer you the usual stuff: a nice salary with a yearly performance bonus, a mobility
      budget or a lease car, a laptop of your own choice and a generous training budget. But next to
      that we offer you an environment in which you can learn, both as a professional and as a
      person. And last but not least, we offer you the chance to shape the culture of a young and
      growing consultancy.

      #### About you

      You are a seasoned **engineer** with a passion for programming. You love to
      gather requirements from the business and translate them into actionable backlog items.
      You are able to **architect** and write software that is born for the cloud. You are
      the go-to person when it comes to cloud. There is no cloud service that you don't know off.
      You're a **polyglot** Programmer (Java, Scala, Javacript/Typescript, Go, Python), and
      constantly updating yourself with the latest and greatest languages. We expect you to be
      a seasoned **VIM** user (just kidding, Emacs or VS Code is also fine). And last but not least,
      you are allergic to the words DevOps and Agile. **You just get shit done**: you build it you run it.


      You have developed web applications **at scale** using containers or serverless technologies on public
      cloud providers. You know what **event sourcing** and eventual consistency is. You are able to split up
      complex monoliths into separate **microservices** (and no, a microservices is NOT just a containerized
      application...). You focus on the **full stack**, not only on features. If there is a way to optimize
      the software delivery pipeline, you're the first to jump on it.
