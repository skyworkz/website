    teaser: Improving the quality and automation of testing at Transavia
    description: >

      In order to improve the quality and automation of testing, 
      Transavia asked us to do a scan of the teams. The software 
      Transavia is using for crew rostering and planning is not 
      developed by Transavia, and each software update could 
      introduce unwanted side effects.


      Skyworkz helped Transavia by scanning the quality of testing
      and provided recommendations on how to improve and automate 
      these tests.
